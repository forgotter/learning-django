This project was developed to assess the skills of students attending NITS-CIT programme. The complete project was built using django at backend, a bit of html and javascript for frontend.

It is an online method to take MCQ based examinations. The set of questions can be added via admin interface. Once the exam is over, the details of every student is saved in database and the score is shown on screen.


The project was developed out of curiosity and to avoid taking exam via paper-pen method and also to provide students to choose their own set of questions.
